#How the Teacher Assistant Works

1. User Starts a Conversation
When you open the app, you see a chat interface with the title "ðŸ¤– Teacher Assistant". You can type questions about math, reading, or writing in the chat input box.

2. The Main App Handles Your Input
The app.py file is like the front desk of a school - it's the first thing you interact with. When you type a question and press enter, it:
Saves your message in the chat history
Shows your message in the chat
Prepares to send your question to the "teacher"

3. The Smart Classifier Decides Which Teacher to Send You To
The graph.py file contains a "smart receptionist" (the TeacherAgent class) that looks at your question and decides which specialist teacher should help you:
Math Teacher: For questions about numbers, equations, geometry, etc.
Reading Teacher: For questions about books, stories, text analysis, etc.
Writing Teacher: For questions about grammar, essays, creative writing, etc.
General Assistant: For greetings or questions that don't fit the other categories
The classifier uses AI to read your question and categorize it automatically.

4. The Specialized Teachers Take Over
Once the classifier decides which teacher you need, it sends you to one of these specialized agents:
Math Agent (math_agent.py):
Helps with math problems step-by-step
Explains concepts clearly
Never gives direct answers - guides you to solve problems yourself
Friendly and encouraging
Reading Agent (reading_agent.py):
Helps with reading comprehension
Analyzes literature and texts
Explains stories and books
Writing Agent (writing_agent.py):
Helps with grammar and writing
Guides essay writing
Assists with creative writing

5. The Conversation Flow
The system works like this:
You ask a question â†’
The classifier reads it and picks the right teacher â†’
That teacher gives you a helpful response â†’
The response appears in your chat â†’
The conversation continues with your next question

6. Memory and Context
The system remembers your entire conversation history, so if you ask follow-up questions like "Can you explain that further?" or "What about the next step?", the teacher knows what you're referring to from earlier in the conversation.

7. Special Features
Greeting Mode: If you say "hello" or ask what the assistant can do, it gives you a friendly introduction explaining its three main subjects
Error Handling: If something goes wrong, it politely asks you to try again
Session Management: Your conversation stays active until you refresh the page

8. The Technical "Glue"
The create_llm_message.py file helps format messages properly for the AI models, and the requirements.txt file lists all the software packages needed to run the system.
In Simple Terms: It's like having a smart receptionist at a school who looks at your question, immediately knows which teacher is best suited to help you, and then connects you with that specialized teacher who gives you personalized, helpful guidance while remembering your entire conversation history.
